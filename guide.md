Every game, book and story has a universe... and this game
has a universe too! This guide explains how to dive deep into it,
get the greatest scores, and enjoy the game as best as you can.

## The menu

_New in version 3.0.0._

This is the main menu. You can pick an option by pressing one of these keys:

- **1**: Start the real game.
- **2**: See the credits scene. Basically, it redirects to the [THANKS.txt](THANKS.txt) file from this repo.
- **3**: Change the skin pack (see the _Advanced settings > Using Skin Packs_ section below).

## Gameplay Keys

If you press some keys, some actions may happen.

### General events

- **P**: Pause the game, saving scores and coordinates. If the game is paused,
  press **P** again to keep playing [^1].
- **Q**: Quit the game, and close the window.
- **R**: Restart the game, and return to the menu [^1].

### Spacecraft (Willpower) keys [^1]

- **Up / down keys**: Use them to move the Willpower, and avoid enemies. You can also use WASD keys (**W and S,** to be more precise)
- **Space**: Send a bullet of _L1-F3_ energized serum, that can destroy both bugs
  and trash!
- **Z**: This yields the Special Attack, if available (see below)

### The Z-Move (Special Attack)

_New in version 4.0.0._

This special move **hits all the mobs with an energy blast!** Though this won't affect
trash items, sorry... Anyway, this is a great way to clear up your space -- just remember
**you can only use this move once** per game!

**_Hint:_** Don't use this move as soon as the game starts. Try to resist the temptation
of using it, unless...

- The Monster (see its section below) moves fast and you can't reach it at all.
- You are *really* overwhelmed by mobs, and could loose the whole game (this happens
  sometimes after there're 100 mobs or less).

## Elements guide

A quick guide to all the elements on the game.

### The Willpower

The Willpower is a modified spacecraft modified by Diddi, to shoot the serum. You
will have to pilot the spacecraft to fight the bugs!

**Fun fact:** This spacecraft came from the same place than its pilot, Diddi. Check out
[@DiddiLeija](https://github.com/DiddiLeija)'s [wiki](https://diddileija.github.io/wiki) to learn more.

### _L1-F3_ energized serum bullet

The Willpower can shoot these fast bullets, to destroy something! Once it touches a bug/trash,
it disappears and cannot damage other enemies. You can shoot an unlimited number of bullets.

### Enemies

They're the creepy creatures that menace the Earth! You're the only one who
can destroy them to save the planet.

These bugs, viruses, bacteria and fungi are the most common element in this game.
They go directly to you, and can have multiple aspects. If they touch your spacecraft,
you will loose the game. They can be destroyed with a bullet, and you can earn **10 points**.
The idea is to **destroy 200 bugs**.

### Space trash

Unfortunately, our loveful Earth's atmosphere is filled up with trash [^2]. But you
can help to wipe them out using your bullets. If you destroy one, you can earn
**50, 100 or even 200 extra points**! However, if they touch you, you will loose the game.

### Messages bar

_New in version 2.0.0._

Here, you can be notified by both Diddi or the "System" when something happens, like an
"event log". For example, when you pause or restart the game, the "System" will tell you. Also, if you find one
of our "easter eggs", you'll get notified too!

### The Monster

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83621221/156233024-c36211fb-1cd3-4c73-a791-98230a593239.png)

_New in version 2.0.0._

Wait...? Where did this giant monster came from...?

This strange but giant enemy **only appears once**. It can move even
faster than the bullets, but also move slowly... it's a randomness thing.
It uses 16x16 pixels, so it's way bigger than everything else in the game
(other mobs and items use 8x8 pixels, or even less!).

The Monster is stronger than regular enemies and trash, so you must
**hit it twice** to defeat it. (_New in version 4.0.0_).

If destroyed, the Monster will leave **1000 extra points**! However, if it
crosses the screen without being defeated, it won't appear again and won't
leave any points. You'll have to start again for a chance to destroy it.

## Advanced settings

**Would you like to further customize your Diddi and the Bugs experience?** Then
keep reading, you may find the following options useful!

### Using Skin Packs

_New in version 4.0.0._

Since 4.0.0, you can use several skin packs to customize the game's aspect. To select one,
press 3 in the main menu, then pick a skin pack (with a live preview).

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-the-bugs/assets/83621221/97e9bf2d-1638-46b1-8231-eb6f58417c9b"></img>

_This is a quick demonstration of the two skin packs bundled to the 4.0.0 release: "Diddi" (the main theme)
and "Training Eli"._

### Adding a skin pack

_New in version 4.0.0._

_**NOTE:** Custom skin packs are only fully allowed in the Python edition of the game. We are working on documentation/support for the Windows-only and Pyxel-packaged editions, and this probably won't be allowed in the HTML version._

If you want to load your own skin pack into your Diddi and the Bugs game, follow these steps:

1. Duplicate the main `resource_diddi.pyxres` file, and name the new file `resource_SKIN_PACK_NAME.pyxres`.
2. Using [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), run `pyxel edit resource_SKIN_PACK_NAME.pyxres`.
3. Use the Pyxel interface to edit your resource. You can edit the mobs and the music freely.
4. Once you're done, save your resource, run Diddi and the Bugs, and select your `SKIN PACK NAME` skin (see the "Using Skin Packs" section above).

You can see the first 5 skin packs (alphabetically sorted) found in the game's main folder. The first skin in that list is loaded during initialization as the default skin [^3].

If you would like your skin to become a default option in the game for everyone, reach out to us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/DfrHxT9ENy)!

[^1]: This function does not apply in the main menu interface.
[^2]: Unfortunately, this is totally true.
[^3]: However, you should note some "default skin names" have preference before any other skin. Then, a skin named _ABC_ will come **after** _Diddi_ (the original skin, and the most preferred). If any of the "preferred skins" is not there, it won't appear.
