# Diddi and the Bugs

My Game Off 2021 entry.

## Introduction

> The Earth is under invasion. A fleet of giant bugs, bacteria, and viruses are
> outside of the planet.
>
> In the meantime, Diddi was developing a secret spacecraft. When his frineds told him of
> the invasion, he decided to visit the brilliant Dr. Chuck (a scientist, and also
> an old friend of Diddi). The doctor gave him the **L1-F3** experimental serum, that kills anything
> alive. That should destroy those bugs...
>
> To ensure that those bugs will be destroyed, Diddi modified his spacecraft to convert it into a
> starfighter that energizes the serum and shoot it. Then, he named the starfighter **Willpower**.
> Suddendly, the Willpower goes outside of the planet, to start the fight...

## Installation

Since the GameOff 2021 event is hosted by [itch.io](https://itch.io), the distributions are available there. The source
code lives in this GitHub repository, but the stable distributions are available at itch.io.

The itch.io page for my game is here: https://diddileija.itch.io/diddi-and-the-bugs.

Once you are there, read the installation instructions and find a stand-alone executable for you (or try the Python edition).
If you don't find what you expected, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or comment in the itch.io page.

### Python version

If you will use Python get sure to have **Python >= 3.7**.

## How to win

Use the energized serum to destroy **200 bugs** and win! In the meantime, you can earn extra points
by destroying space trash. **Try to get all the points as you can!**

Read the [game guide](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-the-bugs/blob/main/guide.md) for more information (and maybe a few hints!).

## Game engine

This game is made using [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), a Python tool for retro games. The executables are uploaded to the itch.io page manually
each time a tag (release) is published here.
